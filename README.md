**First time project setup**

You as well use the [Online Generator](https://mandrasch.github.io/ddev-pull-wp-generator/).

1. Copy `.ddev/example.config.yaml` to `.ddev/config.yaml`
1. Configure SSH host, user and WordPress path on server in `.ddev/config.yaml`
1. Configure Child theme folder name in `.ddev/config.yaml` (optional)
3. Adjust child theme folder name in `.gitignore` (optional)
4. Run `ddev start` and `ddev auth ssh`

**Pull in your latest site content**

1. Run `ddev pull ssh`

## üíæ &nbsp;ddev pull backup

Create and download a BackWpUp backup-file from your live site, import it to your local DDEV project.

## Technical Documentation

Pull scripts are import steps for database and files which are stored as .yaml-files in `.ddev/providers`. They can be executed via `ddev pull`. See [DDEV pull (providers)](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/providers/provider-introduction/) documentation for more insights.

 Design, test  and develop sites in local isolated [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) project environments without breaking the live site.

### Reset / delete

- `git clean -fdx -e .ddev`
    - removes all synced (untracked) files and directories, but without deleting the DDEV folder
- `git clean -fdx`
    - removes all untracked files and directories
    - if .ddev/config.yaml is untracked, it will be removed as well
    - you need to run 'ddev start' again afterwards
- `ddev delete -O`
    - deletes DDEV project with database and containers (git-tracked files will be kept)
